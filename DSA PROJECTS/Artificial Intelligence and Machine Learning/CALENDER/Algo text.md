# **Q-learning Based Study Schedule Generator - Python Script**

This Python script generates a weekly study schedule using Q-learning. The schedule accommodates fixed events, variable study goals, and user-defined sleep schedules. The script ensures no overlap between events and optimizes study time distribution.

## **Features**

- **Q-learning Algorithm**:
  - Uses Q-learning to optimize the study schedule based on given parameters.
  
- **Fixed and Variable Events**:
  - Handles both fixed events (with specified start and end times) and variable events (with specified weekly hours).

- **User-defined Goals**:
  - Incorporates user-defined study goals for variable events.
  
- **No Overlap**:
  - Ensures no overlap between fixed and variable events.
  
- **Sleep Schedule**:
  - Considers user-defined sleep schedules to avoid scheduling events during sleep hours.
