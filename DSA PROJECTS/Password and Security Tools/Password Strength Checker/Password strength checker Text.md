# **Password Strength and Entropy Calculator - Python Script**

This Python script calculates the strength and entropy of a given password. It determines the password's strength based on entropy value and estimates the time required to crack the password using brute-force methods.

## **Features**

- **Entropy Calculation**:
  - Calculates the entropy of the password based on the number of unique characters and the length of the password.
  
- **Password Strength Evaluation**:
  - Categorizes password strength as `Strong`, `Moderate`, or `Weak` based on the entropy value.
  
- **Cracking Time Estimation**:
  - Estimates the time required to crack the password using a given rate of guesses per second.
  - Converts the estimated time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
